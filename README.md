## Requirements

## CocoaPods
If you want to add you own pods or update existing, you need to install cocoapods.

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```


To integrate any pod into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'BankexWallet' do
#add your new pod here
pod 'web3swift'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```
